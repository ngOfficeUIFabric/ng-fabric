# Contributing to ng-OfficeUIFabric
First and foremost, we want anyone who wants to help with the project to feel welcome to jump in! 

##Not sure where to get started or how to help? 
Check the [issues]() list for items flagged as **help-wanted** and jump into the [ngOfficeUIFabric Slack team](http://ngofficeuifabric.slack.com) to join the discussion and express your interest... if you aren't a member to the slack team [request an invite](http://ngofficeuifabric-slackin.azurewebsites.net).

A project like this with many community contributors donating their own time does need to have a few rules in place that everyone follows so this feels like a single body of work and one part of the project is familiar to other parts.

Please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/ngOfficeUIFabric/ng-officeuifabric/wiki) for full details on contributing to the project. There you will find the following details:

- Rules & guidelines
- Setting up a local source enlistment
