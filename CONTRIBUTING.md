# Community Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to become an active contributor to this project please read the following guidelines. Contributors are not only welcomed, they are wanted!

In general, if it's going to take a long time to review a PR, we'll likely request you break it up.

## Questions?

Please do not open issues for general support questions as the GitHub issues list should be used for feature requests & bug reports. You've got a better chance of getting a response in a discussion in our open Slack team [ngofficeuifabric.slack.com](https://ngofficeuifabric.slack.com) (if you aren't in the team, [request a free invite](http://ngofficeuifabric-slackin.azurewebsites.net/)). As we have more people using this design package, [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ng-office-ui-fabric) will be another option for questions.

## Fixing Typos

Typos are embarrassing! Most PR's that fix typos will be accepted. In order to make it easier to review the PR, please narrow the focus instead of sending a huge PR of fixes.

Be sure to review the **[Pull Requests](/ng-officeuifabric/blob/docs-update/docs/guides/PULL-REQUESTS.md)** page before submitting PRs.

## Think You've Found a Bug?

It's going to happen, let's face it, so let's talk about how to deal with it. In order to get working on a bug help us help you - you must provide at least a _minimal_ reproduction scenario using something like http://plnkr.co or http://codepen.io. Having a live reproduction scenario provides a ton of information and avoids a lot of back & forth. This lets developers figure out quickly if there is really a bug, a coding issue or if the issue is already being fixed & is a duplicate issue.

Minimal reproduction steps & an example will be required in order to save developers time & allow more progress & bug squashing by contributors.

If you don't provide reproduction steps, your issue can't be investigated. If you file an issue without repro steps, you'll be asked for a repro scenario. If you don't provide it then your issue is going to be closed because you didn't supply enough info. Help others help you!

To submit a big or issue, use the [Issues](https://github.com/ngOfficeUIFabric/ng-officeuifabric/issues) list for this repo.

## DO's & DON'Ts

- **DO** follow the coding style described in the [CODING](/ng-officeuifabric/blob/docs-update/docs/guides/CODING.md).
- **DO** follow the directive checklist described in the [DIRECTIVE-CHECKLIST](/ng-officeuifabric/blob/docs-update/docs/guides/DIRECTIVE-CHECKLIST.md); we will check it when you submit a PR that includes a new / updated directive.
- **DO** follow the same project and test structure as the existing project.
- **DO** include tests when adding new functionality and features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
- **DO** keep discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the conversation.
- **DO NOT** submit PR's for coding style changes.
- **DO NOT** surprise is with big PR's. Instead file an issue & start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
- **DO NOT** commit code you didn't write.
- **DO NOT** submit PR's that refactoring existing code without a discussion first. 

## Submitting Feature Requests & Design Change Requests
Feature requests and Design Change Requests (DCRs) are an important part of the life cycle of any software project. Please log these as [Issues](https://github.com/ngOfficeUIFabric/ng-officeuifabric/issues) in the repo. 

When opening any feature requests, consider including as much information as possible, including: 

- Detailed scenarios enabled by the feature or DCR.
- Information about your use case or additional value the feature will provide.
- Make note of whether you are opening an issue you would like the Microsoft team or another community member to work on or if you are looking to design & develop the feature yourself.
- Any potential caveats or concerns you may have already thought about.
- A miniature test plan or list of test scenarios is always helpful.
