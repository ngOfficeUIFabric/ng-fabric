# This script is used to automate and speed up the merging of PR's. It prompts for the
#   PR number & source repo+branch at first, then it does the following:
#   1. create a new branch `pr###` from `dev`
#   2. pulls the code from the remote repo+branch into the new local `pr` branch
#   3. removes `node_modules` & `dist` folders
#   4. installs all node modules
#   5. cleans all typescript
#   6. compiles all TypeScript to JavaScript
#   7. vets all code
#   8. runs all tests
#   9. builds library
#   10. launches local demo
