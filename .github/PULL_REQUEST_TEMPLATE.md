When submitting a pull request, make sure you do the following:

- [ ] submit the PR to the `dev` branch on the main repo, **not** the `master` branch
- [ ] include a brief description what the PR is for in the subject
- [ ] in the body, explain what the PR addresses
- [ ] in the body, reference the issue that it closes by number in the format `Closes #000.`
- [ ] squash multiple commits into one and use good commit messages (https://github.com/ngOfficeUIFabric/ng-officeuifabric/blob/master/docs/guides/CODING.md#commit-messages)

Please ensure you have followed the guidelines outlined in the docs: https://github.com/ngOfficeUIFabric/ng-officeuifabric/blob/master/docs/guides/PULL-REQUESTS.md

The branch manager can handle breaking up / squashing commits and updating commit messages if you don't do it, but this will delay your PR from being merged most likely.
