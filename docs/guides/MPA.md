## Install Dependencies

This project has a few minimal dependencies that must be installed on your developer workstation in order to build and contribute to the project.

### Node.js & NPM

Node.js is used for building & testing the project. Install either the latest stable version of Node.js or the long-term support (LTS) version on your machine from https://nodejs.org.

> **NOTE**: The project has been tested with the 4.2.x LTS version & 5.x stable version. 

> **NOTE**: You can also use Node Version Manager (NVM) to install Node.js if you wish. NVM enables you to have multiple versions of Node.js installed on your machine and switch between them for testing on different versions. This is entirely optional: 
>  - OSX: [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
>  - Windows: [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

Installation of Node.js includes NPM, the package manager for Node.js.

### Global NPM Packages

Many parts of the project are implemented using TypeScript, but more importantly the build process is written in TypeScript. As such, you need to install one NPM package globally:

- [typescript](https://npmjs.com/package/typescript): main TypeScript compiler
- [typings](https://npmjs.com/package/typings): Typings type definition utility

```bash
$ npm install -g typescript typings
```

## Clone the Repository

You need the code, so clone it locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ngOfficeUIFabric/ng-officeuifabric.git ng-officeuifabric
```

## Install all NPM Packages

Once you have the codebase, you need to install the NPM packages the repository depends on. Run the following command to download & install all the packages to the local cloned repo:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Transpile the TypeScript

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) is used to automate entire build & test process. All Gulp tasks are written in TypeScript. Because Node.js will not execute TypeScript, you first need to compile the TypeScript to JavaScript. 

You can see this if you try to get a list of all the gulp tasks after cloning the repository... immediately after running gulp, you will get a strange error about not being able to find modules or files:

```bash
$ gulp

module.js:339
    throw err;
    ^

Error: Cannot find module './build/gulp/config'
    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:337:15)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:287:25)
    at Module.require (module.js:366:17)
    at require (module.js:385:17)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/ac/Dev/Scratch/ng-officeuifabric/gulpfile.js:3:16)
    at Module._compile (module.js:425:26)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:432:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
    at Function.Module._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Module.require (module.js:366:17)
```

To fix this, you need to transpile the TypeScript to JavaScript. This is a one-time requirement and is not necessary to do this again unless:
- you update the build process such as changing or adding Gulp tasks
- you purge all JavaScript transpiled from TypeScript

Transpile all the TypeScript to JavaScript. The following command will download all type definitions & run the TypeScript compiler, `tsc`, telling it to treat the folder (`./`) as a project (`-p`) by looking at the `tsconfig.json` file in the root fo the folder:

```bash
# run this ...
$ npm run build:ts

# or run this ...
$ typings install
$ tsc -p ./
```

> **NOTE**: If you get an error running this command, look at the version of `tsc` you are running. If it isn't at least v1.7, you aren't running the most current version. This commonly happens on Windows as the `PATH` environment variable is likely set to use an order version of the TypeScript compiler. You can check this by inspecting the `PATH` variable by executing `echo %PATH%` on the command line. Notice it points to a version other than v1.7. To fix this, change the `path` environment variable to point to the correct version.

Now you can run gulp:

## Execute All Unit Tests

To execute all unit tests using Karma with the headless browser PhantomJS on the project, execute the following command:

```bash
$ gulp test --specs

[18:28:28] Using gulpfile ~/repos/ac-ng-officeuifabric/gulpfile.js
[18:28:28] Starting 'transpile-ts'...

[18:28:34] Finished 'test' after 2.93 s
```

## View Code Coverage Reports

Karma always generates a code coverage report showing the percentages & lines of code that were covered by unit tests. To view the report, locate the following file and open it in the browser:

```
ng-officeuifabric/coverage/PhantomJS 1.9.8 (Mac OS X 0.0.0)/lcov-report/index.html
```

## Build the Library

Build the library in dev mode so you can try one of the examples:

```bash
$ gulp build-lib --dev
```

## See a Working Directive

To see a working directive, open the following file in a browser to see the `<uif-icon />` directive in action:

```
$ open src/components/icon/demo/index.html
```
