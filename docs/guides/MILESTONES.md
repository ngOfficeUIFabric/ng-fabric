# Milestones & Versioning

We use **[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)** for this project. You can read up about it at the aforementioned link, but the gist of it is as follows:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-release**

## MAJOR

Typically this is only used when a release happens that introduces breaking changes from a previous version. However we will use it to match the current released version of the **[Office UI Fabric](http://dev.office.com/fabric)** released version.

## MINOR

Each time a new component is added to the library we will bump the minor version & issue a new release.

## PATCH

Each time we have a fix / enhancement added to the library we will bump the patch version & issue a new release.

## RELEASE

This is used for release versions. For instance, when we are ready to do a release, we will create a version release like 0.5.0-rc1 which is the release candidate #1 for version 0.5.0. We may have multiple RC's for a version. 

Other options are **alpha** / **beta** as we march to 0.5.0.
